✔Prevention is the only way to control spread of Novel Corona Virus and will lead of flattening of curve.<br />

## :star: Features

✔To check if the person is wearing mask or not.<br />
✔Green: mask Red: no_mask : with their detection probabilities on top of each bounding box.<br />
✔This system is highly scalable and can detect multiple streams in optimal time.<br />
✔This has great use in surveillance and security purpose to find out who all are following the rules.<br />
